Description: Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) tool
 OmegaT's main features are
  - ability to run on any operating system supporting Java
  - use of any valid TMX file as translation reference
  - flexible sentence segmenting (using an SRX-like method)
  - searches in the project and the reference translation memories
  - searches in any directory including OmegaT-readable files
  - fuzzy matching
  - smart handling of projects including complex directory hierarchies
  - support for glossaries (terminology checks)
  - easy to understand documentation and tutorial
  - localization in a number of languages.
 .
 OmegaT supports OpenDocument files, Microsoft Office files (using
 OpenOffice.org as a conversion filter, or by conversion to HTML),
 OpenOffice.org or StarOffice files, as well as (X)HTML, Java localization
 files or plain text files.
