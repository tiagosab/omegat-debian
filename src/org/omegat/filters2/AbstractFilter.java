 * <ol>
 * <li>Source text is extracted.
 * <li>Tags are converted into shortcuts and these shortcuts are temporarily stored
 * <li>Source text with shortened tags is sent to OmegaT core
 * <li>Core returns a translation (or the same text if there's no translation)
 * <li>Tags shortcuts are expanded in translated text
 * <li>Translated text is written into the output file
