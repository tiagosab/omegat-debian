 * Interface for dictionary access.

 * Each dictionary format reader should implement this interface. Each instance
 * of this interface represents one dictionary.
 * 
 * Simplest dictionay implementation can just read full dictionary data into
 * map, but we don't recommend it, because it's very memory consuming algorithm.
 * Recommended way is to just read article's names and store some short data,
 * like position in dictionary file, in the value of map. After that,
 * 'readArticle' method could read dictionary file. OS will cache dictionary
 * file against slow access.
