/**
 * Class to compute Levenshtein Distance.
 *
 * <p/>
 * Levenshtein distance (LD) is a measure of the similarity between two strings,
 * which we will refer to as the source string (s) and the target string (t).
 * The distance is the number of deletions, insertions, or substitutions
 * required to transform s into t.
 *
 * <p/>
 * For example,
 * <ul>
 * <li>If s is "test" and t is "test", then LD(s,t) = 0, because
 * no transformations are needed. The strings are already identical.
 * <li>If s is "test" and t is "tent", then LD(s,t) = 1, because
 * one substitution (change "s" to "n") is sufficient to transform s into t.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p/>
 * The greater the Levenshtein distance, the more different the strings are.
 * <p/>
 * Levenshtein distance is named after the Russian scientist
 * Vladimir Levenshtein, who devised the algorithm in 1965.
 * If you can't spell or pronounce Levenshtein, the metric is also sometimes
 * called edit distance.

     * Compute Levenshtein distance between two lists.
     *
     * <p>
     * The difference between this impl. and the canonical one is that,
     * rather than creating and retaining a matrix of size s.length()+1 by t.length()+1,
     * we maintain two single-dimensional arrays of length s.length()+1.
     *
     * <p>
     * The first, d, is the 'current working' distance array that maintains
     * the newest distance cost counts as we iterate through the characters
     * of String s.  Each time we increment the index of String t we are comparing,
     * d is copied to p, the second int[].  Doing so allows us to retain
     * the previous cost counts as required by the algorithm
     * (taking the minimum of the cost count to the left, up one,
     * and diagonally up and to the left of the current cost count
     * being calculated).
     * <p>
     * (Note that the arrays aren't really copied anymore, just switched...
     * this is clearly much better than cloning an array or doing
     * a System.arraycopy() each time through the outer loop.)
     *
     * <p>
     * Effectively, the difference between the two implementations is
     * this one does not cause an out of memory condition when calculating
     * the LD over two very large strings.
     *
     * <p>
     * For perfomance reasons the maximal number of compared items is
     * {@link #MAX_N}.
